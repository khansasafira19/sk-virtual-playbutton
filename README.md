Full Source Code for Virtual Play Button that plays audio and confetti

## DESCRIPTION
This is a completely free source code for "An Virtual Play Button that plays audio and confetti", a webpage I developed using HTML and JavaScript. I referenced from https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti. Also, I do not own the music audio file, it is owned by The Iron Man :D

## HOW TO ENJOY
Before using this code, you gotta make sure you have your local server ready (such xampp or wamp), IDE (I use VSCode), git and composer installed on your computer.

1. Open your terminal in ```htdocs``` (if you use xampp) or ```www``` (if you use wamp)
2. Run this code to clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/khansasafira19/sk-virtual-playbutton.git```
3. That's it, the app should run now. Access it on http://localhost/sk-virtual-playbutton/
